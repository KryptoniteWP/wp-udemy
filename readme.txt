== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I display a course? =

The default shortcode expects a course ID which can be found after adding the course to the cart and taking the ID out of the url of your browser.

[ufwp id="518498"]

Additionally you can string together multiple ids and display multiple courses at once:

[ufwp id="41305,597898"]

More information about the shortcodes can be found in our online [documentation](https://coder.flowdee.de/docs/article/udemy-for-wordpress/).

= How do search for courses? =

Instead of selecting specific ids you can search for courses by keywords.

[ufwp search="css" items="3" lang="de"]

More information about the shortcodes can be found in our online [documentation](https://coder.flowdee.de/docs/article/udemy-for-wordpress/).
